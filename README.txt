About the project:

This project contains three Machine Learning algorithms: Feedforward Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, which are all coded using just Python and NumPy, as well as Pandas for data extraction.  They are coded as generally as possible so that the hyperparameters of each algorithm can all be set within the first few lines of its corresponding file.

Each algorithm is trained on the MNIST data set which can be downloaded at 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
The files "mnist_train.csv" and "mnist_test.csv" must be placed in the directory.  

Python3, NumPy and Pandas must be installed.
